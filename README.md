# Machine Learning Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning Learning Journey repository! This repository serves as a platform for documenting my day-wise revision and learning process of Machine Learning concepts, starting from the basics and progressing towards advanced topics.

## About
In this repository, you will find my day-wise notes, code implementations, and projects as I explore the fascinating realm of Machine Learning. I will be sharing my progress, insights, and learnings each day to provide a comprehensive and transparent view of my learning journey. While I am not an expert in this field, I hope that sharing my journey will inspire and assist fellow learners.

## Contents
The repository is organized as follows:

- **Day-wise Notes**: Contains detailed revision notes for each day of my learning journey. The notes will cover various Machine Learning concepts, algorithms, and techniques, providing explanations, examples, and references for further exploration.

- **Day-wise Code**: Includes code implementations for each day's learning topic. The code will be written in Python and utilize popular libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. You can run the code and experiment with different datasets to deepen your understanding.

## Getting Started
If you are new to Machine Learning, I recommend following these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the day-wise notes in the "Day-wise Notes" directory. Start with Day 1 and progress through each day's topic, building your understanding step by step.

3. Check out the code implementations in the "Day-wise Code" directory. Each day will have its own code file corresponding to the topic covered. Run the code and experiment with different datasets to gain hands-on experience.
